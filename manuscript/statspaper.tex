\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Use this section to answer three questions:
Why is the topic important/interesting?
What has been done on this topic in the literature?
What is your contribution?


% roadmap
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
The data will be presented in Section~2.


\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

Use this section to describe the data that helps to answer your research questions.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:meth}

Use this section to present the methodologies that will generate results by
analyzing the data. Suppose that the radius of a circle is $r$. Then its area is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:area}
  \pi r^2.
\end{equation}

Equation~\eqref{eq:area} is interesting. \lipsum[1-4]

Sometimes I don't want an equation to be numbered such as this one:
\[
  f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left( - \frac{x^2}{2} \right),
\]
which is the density of a standard normal variable.



\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

Table~\ref{tab:rv} summarizes some example draws from some distributions.
