\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Use this section to answer three questions:
Why is the topic important/interesting?
What has been done on this topic in the literature?
What is your contribution?

\lipsum[1-3]

To cite a reference, here are examples.
\citet{xie2015dynamic} did something ... \lipsum[1]

A lot of work has been done \citep[e.g.,][]{xie2015dynamic}.
\lipsum[2]
Some parametric bootstrap sample size approach was proposed by
\citet{dwivedi2017analysis}. 


% roadmap
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
The data will be presented in Section~\ref{sec:data}.
The methods are described in Section~\ref{sec:meth}.
The results are reported in Section~\ref{sec:resu}.
A discussion concludes in Section~\ref{sec:disc}.


\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

Use this section to describe the data that helps to answer your research
questions. Recall Einstein's equation
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mc2}
  E = m c^2,
\end{equation}
which states that the energy $E$ of a particle in its rest frame as the product
of mass ($m$) with the speed of light squared ($c^2$).

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:meth}

Use this section to present the methodologies that will generate results by
analyzing the data. Suppose that the radius of a circle is $r$. Then its area is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:area}
  \pi r^2.
\end{equation}

Equation~\eqref{eq:area} is interesting. \lipsum[1-4]

Sometimes I don't want an equation to be numbered such as this one:
\[
  f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left( - \frac{x^2}{2} \right),
\]
which is the density of a standard normal variable.



\section{Results}
\label{sec:resu}

Table~\ref{tab:rv} summarizes some example draws from some distributions.

What are the limitations of this study?

What are worth pursuing further in the future?
